# Scheduling Algorithm and Schedulability Test Solver
Implements basic versions of the following scheduling algorithms:
* Preemptive Earliest Deadline First Scheduling
* Nonpreemptive Earliest Deadline First Scheduling
* Preemptive Rate Monotonic
* Preemptive Deadline Monotonic

The following schedulability tests are available:
* Utilization (EDF and RM/DM)
* Density (EDF and RM/DM)
* Response Time Analysis
* General Time Demand Analysis

Run:
~~~
./init -h
~~~
for all options

**TODO**

Gen TDA Check for first job completion

Add EDD Scheduling Algorithm

Autorun appropriate tests on schedule
